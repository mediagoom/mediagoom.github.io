### Linux

The *linux* download should work on most distributions as long as they are 64 bit.
In case it should not work you can either [build](https://github.com/mediagoom/mg/wiki/Build) it yourself or use docker.

After download make sure to run `chmod +x mg`

### Window

Window executable inside the zip file should work in both win 32 bit as well as win 64 bit.

### Docker

You can use Docker to run mg. The docker image is [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/mediagoom/nginx-play).
